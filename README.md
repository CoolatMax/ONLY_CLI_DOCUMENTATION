## 💡 Philosophy: Documentation as an Interface

### 

In the "Docs-as-Code" world, CLI documentation isn't just a list of commands; it is a user interface. My goal is to reduce "Time-to-First-Success" by creating command references that are logically structured, easy to parse, and rich with real-world examples.

## 🛠️ Technical Talent Stack

### 

*   **Syntax:** POSIX-compliant command structures, flags, and arguments.
    
*   **Workflows:** Installation scripts, configuration management, and troubleshooting.
    
*   **Tools:** Markdown, Git, GitHub Codespaces, and Linux/Bash environments.

## 📐 My Documentation Standards

### 

1.  **The Help Command Rule:** Every command must be explained as clearly as the `--help` output.
    
2.  **Contextual Examples:** I never provide a command without a real-world use-case example.
    
3.  **Error Empathy:** I document what happens when things go _wrong_, not just when they go right.

## 📈 Real-World Application

### 

I currently apply these high-resolution documentation standards to cybersecurity products including **EDR, XDR, and EMM** at **MicroWorld Software Solutions**. My work bridges the gap between complex security protocols and actionable terminal commands.
